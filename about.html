                <h3 class="about-heading">Professional Journey</h3>
                <p>
                    I started my career in the creative space as a graphic designer, then moved into UI/UX design, where I learned to craft interfaces that are intuitive, accessible, and visually compelling.  
                    My curiosity for technology led me to full-stack engineering, where I now bridge design and development to create solutions that are both functional and beautiful.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Over the past 5+ years, I have designed and developed **web applications, dashboards, e-commerce platforms, AI-driven tools**, and more.  
                    My work integrates frontend frameworks like <strong>React & Next.js</strong> with robust backend systems powered by <strong>Node.js</strong> and secure APIs.  
                    I also specialize in <strong>cybersecurity, penetration testing, and performance optimization</strong>, ensuring every project is fast, reliable, and secure.
                </p>

                    I thrive in high-performance environments and excel at collaborating with cross-functional teams to transform ideas into tangible results.
